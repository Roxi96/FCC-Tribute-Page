            <p id="img-caption">Katherine Johnson loved math. Early in her career, she was called a “computer.” She helped NASA put an astronaut into orbit around Earth. And then she helped put a man on the Moon.</p>

        <h4>Here's a time line of Katherine Johnson:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><span>1918</span> - Katherine Johnson was born as Creola Katherine Coleman on August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs.</li>
            <li><span>1929</span> - Katherine started high school.</li>
            <li><span>1937</span> - She graduated from West Virginia State University.</li>
            <li><span>1939</span> - She was selected to be one of the first African American students to enroll at West Virginia University at Morgantown. In 1939 she also married James Goble.</li>
            <li><span>1953</span> - She began work as a computer at NASA.</li>
            <li><span>1956</span> - Her husband died</li>
            <li><span>1960</span> - She co authored a paper on calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit.</li>
            <li><span>1961</span> - She calculated the path for Freedom 7</li>
            <li><span>1962</span> - John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth. By that time, NASA had begun to use electronic computers. However, before Glenn left the ground, he wanted to make sure that the electronic computer had planned his flight correctly. He asked to have Johnson double check the computer’s calculations.</li>
            <li><span>1969</span> - Katherine was also part of the team that calculated where and when to launch the rocket for the Apollo 11 mission of 1969, which sent the first three men to the Moon.</li>
            <li><span>1981</span> - She retired from NASA in 1986.</li>
            <li><span>2015</span> - In 2015 she was awarded the U.S Presidential Medal of Freedom</li>
            <li><span>2016</span> - In 2016 NASA honored her by naming a building after her. The building is called the Katherine G. Johnson computational research facility. In 2016 the book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race. The movie was also released.</li>
